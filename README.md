# GithubIssuesListUsingMVVM

In this project I am getting the api from https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-repository-issues

The base URL is https://api.github.com and have to pass owner name and repository as the path paramters. In this API I am fetching data like issuetitle, issueNumber, issueCreated and issueUser then displayed in the list.
